# NAGL-MBIS
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A collection of models to predict conformation independent MBIS atom-centred charges for molecules, built on the [NAGL](https://github.com/SimonBoothroyd/nagl)
package by SimonBoothroyd.

## Installation

Environments are managed with [pixi](https://pixi.sh). First clone the repository from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bismuthadams1/nagl-mbis.git
cd nagl-mbis
```

Then install one of the provided environments (this package is installed in editable mode automatically):

| Environment      | Contents                                                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `inference`      | Minimal dependencies needed to load the models and predict charges (conda-forge only: `openff-nagl-base`, `pytorch`, `rdkit`; no dgl) |
| `test-inference` | `inference` plus `pytest`                                                   |
| `default`        | Full development environment, including the [nagl fork](https://github.com/bismuthadams1/nagl) and dgl used for training |
| `splitting`      | Dependencies for the dataset splitting scripts in `scripts/dataset` (linux-64 only) |

```bash
# minimal environment for computing charges
pixi install -e inference
pixi run -e inference python my_script.py

# full development environment
pixi install
pixi shell
```

The models were trained with a [fork of NAGL](https://github.com/bismuthadams1/nagl) which requires dgl, but are
evaluated with the pure PyTorch implementation in [openff-nagl](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-nagl). The
tests check that the charges match those of the original implementation. Note that:

- if a molecule contains several fragments (e.g. a salt), each fragment is predicted separately, so the charges of
  each fragment sum to its own formal charge;
- as molecules are parsed with the OpenFF toolkit, radicals are not supported.

To run the tests:

```bash
pixi run test                        # full test suite in the default environment
pixi run -e test-inference test      # tests which only need the inference dependencies
```

## Quick start
NAGL-MBIS offers a number of pre-trained models to compute conformation-independent MBIS charges, these can be loaded
using the following code in a script

```python
from naglmbis.models import load_charge_model

# load two pre-trained charge models
charge_model = load_charge_model(charge_model="nagl-gas-charge-wb")
# load a model trained to scf dipole and mbis charges
charge_model_2 = load_charge_model(charge_model="nagl-gas-charge-dipole-wb")
```

A list of the available models can be found in naglmbis/models/models.py

We can then use these models to predict the corresponding properties for a given [openff-toolkit](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit) [Molecule object](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/users/molecule_cookbook.html#cookbook-every-way-to-make-a-molecule) or rdkit `Chem.Mol`.

```python
from openff.toolkit.topology import Molecule

# create ethanol
ethanol = Molecule.from_smiles("CCO")
# predict the charges (in e)
charges = charge_model.compute_properties(ethanol.to_rdkit())["mbis-charges"]
```

For computing partially polarised charges, we can use the class ComputePartialPolarised

```python
from openff.toolkit.topology import Molecule
from naglmbis.models.base_model import ComputePartialPolarised
from naglmbis.models import load_charge_model

gas_model = load_charge_model(charge_model="nagl-gas-charge-dipole-esp-wb-default")
water_model = load_charge_model(charge_model="nagl-water-charge-dipole-esp-wb-default")

polarised_model = ComputePartialPolarised(
   model_gas = gas_model,
   model_water = water_model,
   alpha = 0.5 #scaling parameter which can be adjusted
)

partial_charges = polarised_model.compute_polarised_charges(ethanol.to_rdkit())
print(partial_charges)
```

## Using the charges in a simulation

To use the charges in a simulation, we first create an Interchange object (following on from above):
```
from openff.toolkit import Quantity, unit

charges = polarised_model.compute_polarised_charges(ethanol.to_rdkit())

# Convert the charges to a 1D numpy array
charges = charges.detach().numpy().astype(float).squeeze()

# Assign the charges to the molecule and normalise them
ethanol.partial_charges = Quantity(
            charges,
            unit.elementary_charge,
        )
ethanol._normalize_partial_charges()
```
Now, create the interchange object. Note that the charge_from_molecules argument is critical, otherwise we'll end up with AM1-BCC charges. Also note that you will need to install [openff-interchange](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-interchange) e.g. `mamba install -c conda-forge openff-interchange`.
```
from openff.toolkit import ForceField
from openff.interchange import Interchange

force_field = ForceField("openff-2.2.1.offxml")
interchange = Interchange.from_smirnoff(force_field=force_field, topology=[ethanol], charge_from_molecules=[ethanol])
print(ethanol.partial_charges)
```
You can then run a simulation with your engine of chioce, for example with OpenMM as shown [here](https://docs.openforcefield.org/en/latest/examples/openforcefield/openff-interchange/ligand_in_water/ligand_in_water.html).

# Models

## Summary of Models

This repository includes several partial charge models. The table below summarizes each model’s training objectives, the level of theory used for the training data (see details below), and the phase (gas or water) in which the QM data was calculated.
For brevity:

* Q = on-atom charges

* μ = dipole moment

* V = electrostatic potential (ESP)

The models in this repo were trained from two QM datasets. 

1. The models starting with `nagl-v1`:

These models were trained on the [OpenFF ESP Fragment Conformers v1.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2022-01-16-OpenFF-ESP-Fragment-Conformers-v1.0) dataset
which is on QCArchive. 

These models were computed using HF/6-31G* with PSI4 and was split 80:10:10 using the deepchem maxmin spliter.  

2. The rest of the models:

These models were trained on the [MLPepper RECAP Optimized Fragments v1.0
](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2024-07-26-MLPepper-RECAP-Optimized-Fragments-v1.0) and [MLPepper-RECAP-Optimized-Fragments-Add-Iodines-v1.0
](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2024-10-11-MLPepper-RECAP-Optimized-Fragments-Add-Iodines-v1.0) datasets.

These models were computed using $\omega\text{B97X-D/def2-TZVPP}$ with PSI4 and was split 80:10:10 using the deepchem maxmin spliter.   

## Training

The training scripts are located in the scripts subfolder in this repo. This is split into further subfolders.

1. **dataset** -  this subfolder contains all the scripts to pull down the QM data from qcarchive.
